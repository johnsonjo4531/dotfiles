# My themeswitcher for bash

Just run my-theme command line script to switch themes.

I wanted a quick way to switch out my theme in bash so I decided to put
MY_THEME as a variable as the only line in a particularly named bash script.

The current supported themes for my dotfiles setup are located
in the my-themes.txt file in this directory.
If I wanted to add more I would have to hook it all up
to nvim, tmux, fzf, starship, etc.
