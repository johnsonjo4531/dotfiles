# My Dotfiles

These are various configuration/dotfiles that I want to use across my machines.

Currently here:

- neovim / lazyvim
- tmux
- scripts for my dotfiles (currently only make-dots which restows my dotfiles if needed)

## Initializing

Install/clone into `~/dotfiles` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnsonjo4531/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Then go into the `~/dotfiles` directory

```
cd ~/dotfiles
```

Then run `make`

```bash
make
```

That's it!

## Tech

These dotfiles use GNU Stow
